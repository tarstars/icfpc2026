# Grading

Source: https://icfpcontest2026.com/grading, captured 2026-07-24 from the SPA
bundle (`assets/grading-CTElrHZs.js`). Prose verbatim.

## Problem Sets

Teams are ranked by their performance across all graded problem sets on the
problem sets page. The problems in the "Ungraded Practice Problems" section
are not graded and do not count towards your team's performance.

## Public & private test cases

Your programs are tested using a problem's test cases. Some test cases are
public and some are private. Each test describes output that your program
must produce given some (or no) input.

Your program passes a test case as soon as it emits the correct output; it
doesn't have to halt.

Submissions are graded against both public and private test cases. Public
cases are shown in full in two places: on the problem page, and in the
editor's test cases tab (on the right edge of the editor). The tab also runs
your program against them and submits your work.

Private cases are never shown, but are intended to exercise the same behavior
as the public cases — no hidden tricks. They exist to make it difficult to
hardcode output for each test case.

## Submitting your work

The simplest way to submit a solution is to open the problem in the editor
and press "submit program" in the test cases tab.

Each problem page also lists other ways to submit (uploading a file, using
the API, etc).

Grading is done asynchronously. Your submission may be rejected if your team
has many pending submissions (if this happens, wait a bit and try again).
Track your team's submissions and their results on the submissions page.

You are graded only on your best submission for each problem. Submitting will
never lower your score.

## Program Scoring

Each program is given a score. **A lower score is always better.**

The vast majority of problems use **footprint-tick scoring**, which is
computed as:

    max(width, height)² × (average ticks across all test cases)

A test case's tick count is the number of ticks until your final correct
output value is emitted (for display assignments, until your final frame
matches). Your program does not need to halt; ticks after that point are not
counted.

A small number of problems use **footprint** scoring — that is, the score
does not depend on the speed of the program:

    max(width, height)²

Width and height are defined as the bounding box of your **entire** program.

Each problem page specifies how the problem is scored.

## Ranking, Scoring, and Winning

Your team may receive up to **2 points** for each graded problem. To prevent
hardcoding the public test case answers, you are only eligible to score
points if you pass at least one private test case. On a problem with no
private test cases, passing any test case makes you eligible.

Up to one point is granted based on the fraction of test cases you pass:

    test-case points = passing test cases / total test cases

Up to one additional point is granted based on your ranking against the other
eligible teams. First, teams are ranked by the number of test cases they
pass. Teams which pass all test cases are additionally ranked by their
program's score (lower is better). Ties are allowed.

    ranking points = (other eligible teams you rank above or tie) / (other eligible teams)

If you are the only eligible team, you receive the full ranking point.

Your team's total score is the sum of your highest score on every problem.

## Rounds

A test case contains one or more rounds. A round is an input/expected-output
pair. All rounds run against a single run of your program (there is no reset
between rounds).

The input for round N+1 is not available until all output for round N has
been received.

Some rounds expect no output; the input for the following round is then
unlocked immediately.

In the editor, `/` separates rounds in the input and expected output boxes.
For example `1 42 / 2 41 42` represents two rounds.

## Display assignments

Some assignments are judged on the LM-75 display instead of on your program's
output. The problem page will tell you this, and will show you pictures for
expected output instead of text.

Judging is still a streaming compare; every frame your display commits (each
SWAP, routed through the bottom of the display) must equal the next expected
frame in order.

Your program must contain exactly one display at the resolution that the
assignment states. It is an error to emit any output in a display-judged
program.

Display problems may be round based; if they are, frames gate the next round
of input exactly like regular output does.

## ASCII

Some problems may ask you to read or write ASCII. ASCII is a mapping from an
integer between 0 and 127 to a character. For example, since 104 is the
ASCII-encoding of "h" and 105 is the ASCII-encoding of "i", "hi" would be
encoded in ASCII as `104 105`.

All values in Littleman are ultimately decimal integers, and that is still
true when working with ASCII — the letter "h" is transmitted as 104.

To make working with ASCII easier, the editor automatically enables
ASCII-mode when working on ASCII problems. ASCII mode decodes numbers into
characters in test cases automatically. This can be disabled using the
program menu in the top bar.

For your reference, a full ASCII table is available at `/ascii.txt`.

## Limits

Programs are limited to 10 MB.

Every program is run with a step-count limit. Hitting the step limit ends
your program. For most problems the limit is **5 million steps**. A few
problems may have smaller or larger limits — this will be mentioned on the
problem page.

Our internal grading infrastructure has a few more internal limits (e.g. on
the amount of time spent executing a program). Most well-behaved programs
should never see these limits.
